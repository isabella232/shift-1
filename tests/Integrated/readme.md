# Purpose
The interated test suite is built to test all the code together in one place, including testing against the database to ensure that all the pieces are connected correctly. Testing various pieces in isolation is great, and helps to identify low level problems but does not cover any bugs that may result from API changes.

# Coverage
The tests here are grouped by module and represent the routes and parameters available to a given module. Developers should be testing each route through as many paths as possible, with the end goal being 100% coverage via the integrated test suite.
