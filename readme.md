# Shift

Shift is a development platform for SAAS applications. It uses the latest and greatest technologies, including Laravel 5 and Angular JS 1.2.x (1.3+ doesn't support IE8), and utilises the best development patterns and methodologies currently in use in the market. As a result, Shift is a robust, secure, feature-rich development platform for anyone wanting to create a product that is designed for SAAS.

## Installation

Shift is a package that can be installed via composer, in the usual manner:

    composer require tectonic/shift --prefer-source

As Shift is still currently in a beta state, no official releases have been created.
